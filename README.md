### Project 2: Airbnb (Artificial Neural Networks)

#### Project Summary
Airbnb is a company that provides an online marketplace for short-term rentals of homes and apartments. Much of the data from Airbnbâ€™s website has been compiled and made publicly available on the website Inside Airbnb. For this project, a sample of the Airbnb listings from Washington, DC, scraped in July 2023 was analyzed and used to build an Artificial Neural Network model.
